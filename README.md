OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marked Men. What a ride! 😅 I seriously didn’t know whether to laugh or roll my eyes at some of the scenes. You’d totally get why when you see how over-the-top some moments are. Like, come on, dude—who even writes this stuff? 😂

Anyway, I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it on my layover, and I'm just kinda beat, you know? Those super dramatic plot twists—draining! Especially after a long flight. It’s like they took all the clichés and put them in a blender. But hey, it’s sort of entertaining in that totally ridiculous way. I was half-expecting someone to start parachuting out of the doom, waving a flag or something. 😆 

> The lead guy, though... he had that I'm a cool mysterious man thing going on, but oh please, I've seen passengers on red-eye flights look more enigmatic. Haha! I mean, you gotta enjoy the cheesiness now and then, but that was something else. I swear, I could probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and make a drinking game out of it: take a sip every time someone dramatically removes sunglasses. 😂

Remember you told me it was worth a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Yeah, I totally see what you mean now. It’s like, you wanna know what happens next, but at the same time, you're just thinking, Do I really wanna know? 😜 And the special effects—what even? I've seen more realistic turbulence on a bumpy landing. 

Ha! Random thought, why do I get the feeling that the scriptwriter was like, “meh, whatever” halfway through? I've totally been there. Oh, and here’s the kicker—I was sitting there, all snuggled in my hotel room, having to pause and replay some of the dialogues just 'cause they were too mad to comprehend. 😂 Makes me miss those quiet flight moments when I can just shut my brain off.

You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   whenever you have time, if you're up for some mindless fun. I mean, no regrets 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 it, but maybe next time I’ll go for something a bit less... extra? You get it. 😉

float planeMiles = distanceFlown/airSpeed; // Seriously, why am I even thinking about this right now?

Alright, I should probably crash and get some rest before tomorrow’s flight. Catch you later, and lemme know if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it! 🌟
